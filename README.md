# PySpark_internship

## Goal

The goal of the project was to determine the trustworthiness of sensor data flow in a resilient cloud service at the scale of a smart city.


## State of Art

We have base our project to some research of the CaC lab of the University of Arizona.
Our goal was to use some big data frameworks such as Spark in order to handle any scale of flow.

## Results

We have found some very satisfying results.

### Different kinds of attacks:

we have been able to determine the differents kinds of attacks such as the following result:
